### Description

The Beehive project brings together students/volunteers looking for real world experience with non-profit organizations. The npo's will post coding and tech projects they need completed, but can not afford to hire a full time staff member or company to complete. This mutually beneficial system will allow npo's to receive good quality work and volunteers can gain real-world experience.
